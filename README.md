# WatchMate ðŸŽ¥ðŸ’¬

A Chrome extension that enables real-time chat functionality for YouTube videos, allowing users to chat with others watching the same video simultaneously.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Connect with other viewers watching the same YouTube video
- **Automatic Video Detection**: Automatically detects the current YouTube video and creates a dedicated chat room
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, minimal chat interface that overlays on YouTube pages
- **Instant Messaging**: Send and receive messages in real-time using Ably's messaging service

## How It Works

WatchMate creates a unique chat room for each YouTube video using the video ID. When you visit a YouTube video page, the extension:

1. Extracts the video ID from the URL
2. Connects to a dedicated Ably channel for that video
3. Displays a chat interface overlay on the page
4. Enables real-time messaging with other viewers

## Installation

### For Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WatchMate
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the WatchMate directory

5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and be active

### For Users

2. Install the extension
3. Visit any YouTube video page
4. The chat interface will automatically appear

4. **View Messages**: See messages from other viewers in real-time

## Project Structure

```
WatchMate/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # Chrome extension manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ content-script.js      # Content script that injects the chat functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ injected.js           # Main chat logic and UI
â”œâ”€â”€ ably.min.js          # Ably real-time messaging library

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **Ably Realtime**: Real-time messaging service for chat functionality
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: For browser integration

### Key Components

- **Content Script**: Injects the necessary scripts into YouTube pages
- **Injected Script**: Handles the chat UI and Ably integration
- **Ably Integration**: Manages real-time messaging channels

### Architecture

The extension uses a three-tier injection system:
1. `content-script.js` loads first and injects the Ably library
2. Once Ably is loaded, it injects `injected.js`
3. `injected.js` creates the chat interface and handles messaging

## Configuration

### Ably API Key

The extension currently uses a hardcoded Ably API key. For production use, you should:

1. Replace the API key in `injected.js` with your own Ably key
2. Consider implementing a more secure key management system

```javascript
// In injected.js, line 8
const ably = new Ably.Realtime({
    key: "YOUR_ABLY_API_KEY_HERE",
    clientId: clientId,
});
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Chrome Extensions

### Local Development

1. Make changes to the source files
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`

### Building for Production
